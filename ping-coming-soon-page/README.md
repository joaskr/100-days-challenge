## Overview

### Day 8 of 100 days challenge

The second week surprised me with it's intensity and magically I got delayed with projects from day 8, 9 and 10. I guess I need to find a little while to finish them.
This one was more challenging than I expected, probably because I was too tired to write without making typos but I finally finished it. Well, I'll probably fix it multiple times after I push it but at least it's done.
