# One Direction song quiz

Today is 7th day of the challenge. I was running low on creativity today but during lunch I came up with the idea of a virtual keyboard because why not.

## Overview

### Day 7 of 100 days challenge

I had some challenges - initially with grid planning and later with assigning keyboard events to correct buttons. There are some issues with local keyboards but it works mostly okay. Also, since this is a project for computers I added special screen for small devices.
