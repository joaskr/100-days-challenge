## Overview

### Day 1 of 100 days challenge

During the first day I wanted to start with something easy but satisfying. That's why I chose a frontend mentor challenge. A simple HTML & CSS page is a good way to start a challenge and I can proudly say that I didn't have to google "how to center a div". That's an acomplishment.
